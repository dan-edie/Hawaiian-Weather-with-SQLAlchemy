# Hawaiian Weather with SQLAlchemy

This is a project that uses SQL and SQLAlchemy to perform data analysis.

This project uses data from specific NWS Hawaiian weather stations. A full years worth of preciptation data is extracted with SQLAlchemy and used to create
plots with Matplotlib. The top reporting stations are pulled and identified, and temperature data is examined and shown in a plot.

In addition, data was queried and pulled to create a plot of normal temparatures over a specified period of time.

Next steps:
- More projects that require querying data with SQLalchemy
