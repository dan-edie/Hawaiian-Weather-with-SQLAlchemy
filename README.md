# sqlalchemy-challenge
Project that uses SQL and SQLalchemy along with Pandas to perform data analysis

This project uses data from specific Hawaiian weather stations. A full year's worth of preciptation data is used to create
a plot with Matplotlib. The top reporting stations are also pulled and identified. Temperature data is also examined
and shown in a plot.

For extra work, data was queried and pulled to create a plot of normal temparatures over a specific period of time.

SQLalchemy is a great tool for accessing data and using Pandas to organize and present it.

Next steps:
- More projects that require querying data with SQLalchemy
